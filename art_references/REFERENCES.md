# Reference Guidelines
## File Names
- Files are to be named in `snake_case`
- Files are to be (loosely) named after the sprite/object they represent
- Sprites that have multiple reference files should add a number to the end of the file that represents the number of reference to that sprite: `asteroid.png` `asteroid2.png` `asteroid3.png` etc. 

idk i have nothing else to say
